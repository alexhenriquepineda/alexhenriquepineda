I also built up my project portfolio on GitHub, showcasing my passion and curiosity for data.

I graduated from FATEC in Systems Analysis and Development, where I learned the fundamentals of information technology and software development. Additionally, I completed various certifications in machine learning, recommendation systems, and data visualization, further enhancing my knowledge and skills in these areas
